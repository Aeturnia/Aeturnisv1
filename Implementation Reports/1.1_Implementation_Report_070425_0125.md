## Issue Resolution Timeline

### July 3, 2025
- **09:00-12:00**: Initial monorepo structure creation
- **12:00-15:00**: Package dependencies and cross-package linking
- **15:00-18:00**: Testing infrastructure and CI/CD setup
- **18:00-21:00**: Server implementation and endpoint configuration

### July 4, 2025
- **00:00-01:00**: GitHub Actions workflow creation and Codecov integration
- **01:00-01:15**: TypeScript module system standardization
- **01:15-01:25**: Server restart loop resolution and port configuration

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Server Restart Loop (Priority: Critical)
- **Issue**: Workflow expecting port 5000, server running on 3000
- **Root Cause**: Port mismatch between .replit configuration and server code
- **Solution**: Updated server to use port 5000, corrected host binding to 0.0.0.0
- **Result**: Stable server operation with zero restarts

### 2. TypeScript Module Conflicts (Priority: High)
- **Issue**: ts-node compatibility with ESNext modules
- **Root Cause**: ES module tooling limitations with ts-node
- **Solution**: Pragmatic approach - ESNext for frontend, CommonJS for server
- **Result**: All packages compile successfully with optimal tooling support

### 3. CI/CD Coverage Reporting (Priority: Medium)
- **Issue**: Multi-package coverage aggregation
- **Root Cause**: Codecov configuration for monorepo structure
- **Solution**: Proper lcov file generation and codecov.yml configuration
- **Result**: Comprehensive coverage tracking across all packages
