# README_aeturnis_ai.md

# 🌐 Aeturnis: An AI-Orchestrated Game Development Experiment

_Aeturnis_ is a solo-AI experiment in building a mobile-first MMORPG using three collaborating AI agents—Claude, Replit Agent, and ChatGPT. It’s not just a game—it’s a living research project exploring prompt design, agent handoffs, and fully automated system creation.

---

## 🤖 How It Works

This project is powered by three autonomous AI systems:

| AI | Role | Responsibilities |
|----|------|------------------|
| **Claude** | Planner | Writes detailed prompts, defines system specs |
| **Replit Agent** | Engineer | Executes prompts into live TypeScript code |
| **ChatGPT** | Architect | Performs audits, QA, and integration oversight |

Each system hands off to the next, forming a closed-loop prompt → build → audit cycle.

---

## 🎮 The Game (Testbed)

_Aeturnis_ includes:
- 8 races with unique stats
- Infinite progression (scaling XP system)
- Weapon + magic affinity leveling
- Turn-based combat system
- Real-time movement and multiplayer infrastructure

But the **game is secondary**. It’s a modular scaffold to test how autonomous agents can build software collaboratively.

## ✅ Overview

By the end of this guide, you’ll have:

- A cloud VM running an AI model
- A secure API that Replit can call
- NPCs and AI systems in Aeturnis using this local AI

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Pick a Cloud Provider

Choose one of these services to rent a cloud computer with a GPU:

| Provider     | Notes                         |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| RunPod       | Fast, cheap, beginner-friendly |
| Lambda Labs  | Good support, flat pricing     |
| Paperspace   | Easy notebooks or VMs          |
| Vast.ai      | Flexible, more complex         |
| AWS          | Powerful, more expensive       |

Look for a VM with at least **24–32 GB VRAM** if using Mixtral. LLaMA 3 8B can run on ~16 GB VRAM.

---

## 🖥️ Step 2: Launch Your Cloud VM

1. Choose Ubuntu 22.04 as your OS.
2. Make sure your VM allows SSH access.
3. Start the VM and note your **public IP address**.
4. SSH into your server from your terminal:

```bash
ssh your-username@your-vm-ip
```

---

## 📥 Step 3: Install Ollama (AI Model Runner)

Ollama is an easy tool for running open-source LLMs.

1. In your SSH session, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

2. Start the AI server:

```bash
ollama serve
```

It runs in the background on port `11434`.

---

## 🧠 Step 4: Download an AI Model

1. Pull a model you want to use, like Mixtral:

```bash
ollama pull mixtral
```

2. Test the model by generating a response:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "mixtral",
  "prompt": "Say hello as a blacksmith NPC in a fantasy town."
}'
```

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Make Your AI Accessible Online

By default, Ollama only works locally. You’ll need to expose it securely.

### Option 1: Use Cloudflare Tunnel (Easy)
- Follow instructions at https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/
- Create a public URL without opening ports.

### Option 2: Use NGINX and HTTPS (Advanced)
1. Install NGINX and Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

2. Point your domain/subdomain to your VM IP.
3. Set up HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt:
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

4. Edit your NGINX config to proxy requests to Ollama:
```nginx
location / {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:11434;
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

---

## 🔐 Step 6: Add Basic Security

In your Node.js app or proxy, require an API key header:

```ts
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers.authorization !== 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY') {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  next();
});
```

---

## 🧪 Step 7: Connect from Replit

In Replit:

1. Add to your `.env` file:
```
LOCAL_AI_URL=https://your-ai-server.com/api/generate
LOCAL_AI_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

2. In your code:
```ts
const res = await fetch(process.env.LOCAL_AI_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LOCAL_AI_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'mixtral',
    prompt: 'Speak as a tavern NPC greeting a player.',
    max_tokens: 300
  })
});

const data = await res.json();
console.log(data.response);
```

---

## 🧹 Step 8: Test and Polish

- Test it in Replit live
- Add logging or fallback logic
- Add retry if it fails or takes too long
- Add game logic that reacts to the AI's replies

---

## 🚀 You’re Ready!

You now have your own private, powerful AI system powering Aeturnis — cheaper, faster, and under your control.

You can use this for:

- NPC dialogue
- AI-generated quests
- Player mentor system
- Dungeon master event triggers
- And more

---

# aeturnis-local-ai-integration-guide.md

# 🧠 Aeturnis Online – Local AI Integration Guide (Cloud-Hosted VM)

This guide walks you step by step through how to run an open-source AI model (like Mixtral or LLaMA 3) on a cloud virtual machine (VM), and connect it to your Replit development environment. This will allow Aeturnis to use local AI for things like NPC behavior, narrative generation, and more — **without relying on commercial LLM APIs**.

---

## 🌐 Step 1: Choose a Cloud Provider with GPU Support

Pick a service that gives you access to a cloud machine with a dedicated GPU:

| Provider     | Good Options                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| RunPod       | "Secure Cloud" or "Community GPU"   |
| Lambda Labs  | GPU Cloud VMs                       |
| Paperspace   | Gradient Notebooks or Core Machines |
| Vast.ai      | Custom VM pricing                   |
| AWS          | EC2 with A10G or T4 GPUs            |

You’ll want a VM with at least:

- **24–32 GB VRAM** for Mixtral 8x7B (Quantized)
- **16–24 GB VRAM** for LLaMA 3 8B or Nous Hermes 2

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Set Up the VM and SSH In

1. Launch the VM with Ubuntu 22.04 or similar.
2. Connect via SSH using the credentials your provider gives you:

```bash
ssh user@your-vm-ip
```

---

## 📦 Step 3: Install Ollama (or your preferred LLM server)

We'll use [Ollama](https://ollama.com) because it’s the easiest way to run large models with a simple API.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

Then start the server:

```bash
ollama serve
```

---

## 🧠 Step 4: Download a Model (e.g., Mixtral or LLaMA 3)

```bash
ollama pull mixtral
# Or for LLaMA 3: ollama pull llama3
```

This will download and prepare the model.

You can now run prompts using:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "mixtral",
  "prompt": "Act as a blacksmith NPC named Tharin..."
}'
```

---

## 🌍 Step 5: Expose Your AI API to Replit

1. Use a reverse proxy like NGINX or Caddy to make it accessible over HTTPS.
2. Alternatively, use a tool like [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) to expose it securely.

For a basic HTTPS setup:

- Buy a cheap domain (or use a subdomain)
- Point DNS to your VM IP
- Set up NGINX with HTTPS (via Let’s Encrypt + Certbot)

Example NGINX config:
```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name ai.aeturnis.dev;

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain/fullchain.pem;
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain/privkey.pem;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:11434;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
  }
}
```

---

## 🔐 Step 6: Secure It (API Key or Auth Header)

Add a simple token check middleware if you want to secure access.

In Node.js Express:
```ts
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers.authorization !== 'Bearer YOUR_SECRET') {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  next();
});
```

---

## 💻 Step 7: Connect Replit to Your Local AI

In your `.env` file on Replit:
```
LOCAL_AI_URL=https://ai.aeturnis.dev/api/generate
LOCAL_AI_KEY=YOUR_SECRET
```

In your `NPCService.ts` or wherever you want to use it:

```ts
const response = await fetch(process.env.LOCAL_AI_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.LOCAL_AI_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'mixtral',
    prompt: 'You are a tavern owner named Mira who loves gossip. Say hello to a traveler.',
    max_tokens: 300
  })
});

const npcReply = await response.json();
console.log(npcReply.response);
```

---

## ✅ Step 8: Test, Refine, and Scale

- Test responses in Replit just like any other API
- Add retry logic if needed
- Optional: add logging, usage caps, fallback to Claude/GPT for special content

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ollama listens on `localhost:11434` — expose only through HTTPS reverse proxy.
- Always use token-based auth or IP whitelisting for security.
- You can host multiple models by changing the `model` name in each request.

---

## 🔚 You’re Done!

You now have a full-featured local AI model running in the cloud that your game can call for NPCs, world events, mentor systems, and more — all without paying per-token.

# aeturnis_layperson_overview.md

# 🌐 Aeturnis: The AI-Driven Game Development Experiment

## 👋 Welcome

Aeturnis is not just a video game—it’s a groundbreaking experiment in using Artificial Intelligence to design, build, and manage an entire online role-playing game from scratch. This document explains what Aeturnis is, why it matters, and what makes it one of the most unique game development projects in the world.

---

## 🎮 What Is Aeturnis?

At its surface, Aeturnis is a **mobile-first, text-based MMORPG** (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game). It features:
- 8 playable fantasy races
- Infinite character progression
- A turn-based combat system
- Weapon and magic skill mastery
- Real-time social chat and exploration

But under the hood, **the game is being created entirely by three AI systems working together**, with minimal human coding.

---

## 🤖 The AI Development Team

The project is run by a team of three artificial intelligence systems:

| AI | Role | Responsibilities |
|----|------|------------------|
| Claude (by Anthropic) | The Planner | Designs systems, writes prompts, generates specs |
| Replit Agent | The Engineer | Writes real production code in real-time |
| ChatGPT (by OpenAI) | The Architect | Reviews code, performs audits, maintains consistency |

The human creator acts as the **director**, deciding what to build and when—but almost all of the actual work is done by AI.

---

## 🎯 Why Is This an Experiment?

Most people use AI to help with small parts of a game—writing dialogue, suggesting names, or generating images.

Aeturnis goes **far beyond** that. It’s an experiment to answer this question:

> “Can AI systems create an entire, working game together—without a traditional development team?”

The game itself is just the medium. The **real goal** is to push the limits of collaborative AI.

---

## 🧱 What Makes It Possible?

The project uses:
- A full Replit Teams development environment
- PostgreSQL and Redis databases
- Node.js backend with TypeScript
- Real-time multiplayer using WebSockets
- Strict code quality audits and self-tests

All of these tools are wired into a loop where one AI designs, one builds, and one double-checks the work. This “prompt cycle” repeats hundreds of times.

---

## 📚 Transparency & Documentation

Everything is logged:
- **Prompt Tracker**: Every AI prompt and outcome is recorded
- **Dev Logs**: Daily progress, blockers, and notes
- **Implementation Reports**: Code coverage, test results, and audit scores
- **Glossary**: Shared AI and game terminology
- **Charter**: Defines the rules of how the AIs collaborate

This makes Aeturnis not just a game—but a **researchable framework for future AI tools and creators**.

---

## 🔬 Why Does This Matter?

- It showcases the **future of solo game development**
- It tests how AI can collaborate across roles
- It offers a new way to build and test complex systems
- It creates **publicly visible, modular blueprints** others can study or replicate

Aeturnis is being prepared for submission to grant programs such as:
- Mozilla Creative Media Awards
- National Endowment for the Arts
- Prototype Fund (Germany)
- NYU Game Center Incubator

---

## 📦 What’s Been Built So Far?

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1: Infrastructure | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2: Core Game Systems | 🚧 In Progress |
| Phase 3: Mobile UI/UX | Planned |
| Phase 4: Social & Advanced Features | Planned |
| Phase 5: Content & Balance | Planned |
| Phase 6: Testing & Launch | Planned |

---

## 👥 Who Is Behind This?

Aeturnis is being directed by a single human creator with no formal programming background. The experiment is a personal exploration into AI as a creative partner—and a real example of how far autonomous systems can go when well-coordinated.

---

## 🎥 Coming Soon

- Video overview of how the system works
- Live demo of the early prototype

## 🧠 In Summary

**Aeturnis is what happens when three AIs build a game together.**  
It’s an experiment, a system, a framework—and yes, a game.  
But more than anything, it’s a glimpse into what’s possible when we change how we create.

Thank you for exploring Aeturnis.

## 📌 Project Description

**Aeturnis** is a groundbreaking experiment in collaborative AI-driven game development. It’s a mobile-first MMORPG being designed, built, and audited entirely by a team of three AI systems: Claude (planner), Replit Agent (engineer), and ChatGPT (architect). Aeturnis isn't just a game—it's a modular testing ground for exploring how distributed AI agents can work together to design complex, scalable software systems with minimal human code.

All prompts, audits, and implementation logs are tracked, with full transparency into every interaction. Each feature—combat, inventory, progression—is created via a three-agent handoff cycle that mimics a distributed development team. The project is structured not as a commercial product, but as a replicable model of AI-assisted creative infrastructure.

---

## 🤖 Why This Project Matters

As AI continues to evolve, the tools for software and creative development remain fragmented. Aeturnis proposes an integrated, living blueprint for orchestrating AI systems like a human team—something that’s rarely explored at production depth. It captures live experimental data about prompt design, handoff failure, audit strategies, and task ownership across LLMs.

Aeturnis is also a model for non-programmers and indie creators: a way to build professional-grade tools using only logic, story, and strategic direction. The transparency, structure, and reproducibility of the project make it valuable for researchers, toolmakers, and future AI collaboration platforms.

---

## 🧑 Why I'm the Right Person

I’m a solo creator conducting a long-term AI development experiment. I’ve built the full stack development pipeline, prompt protocol, roadmap, and legal framework to structure the collaboration between agents. I’m not a professional developer—I'm the conductor of this system, and that's the point. This work is deeply documented, reproducible, and intended to show what's possible with minimal resources but maximum orchestration.

---

## 💰 What Funding Will Enable

- Continued infrastructure (Claude, Replit Agent, ChatGPT Pro)
- Hosting for alpha testing, documentation, and demo builds
- Expanded documentation (video explainers, retrospective reports)
- Time and tooling for prompt refinement, failures, and playtesting

---

## 💵 Budget Estimate

Total request: **$3,300 USD**

Breakdown:
- Claude Pro / ChatGPT Pro / Replit Agent Credits → $1,700
- Hosting, backups, deployment (12mo) → $240
- Video, docs, licensing tools → $500
- Time for integration, polish, outreach → $860

# poa-enhancement-plan.md

# 🛠️ POAD Enhancement Plan for Aeturnis Project

This document outlines proposed enhancements to the Prompt-Orchestrated AI Development (POAD) methodology based on industry best practices and recent research into multi-agent AI systems.

---

## 🔁 Integration Points in Current Aeturnis Development Loop

| POAD Phase | Enhancement | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Prompt Design (Claude)** | ✅ SOP Prompt Templates | Define standardized prompt structure for each feature type (e.g., Combat, Inventory) including required input sections, validations, and test definitions. |
| **Prompt Design (Claude)** | ✅ Test-First Specification | Include test cases *before* implementation details; all agents treat tests as primary spec. |
| **Prompt Design (Claude)** | ✅ Shared Memory Object | Introduce a `agent-context.json` that carries state across Claude → Replit → ChatGPT, maintaining APIs, types, test results, etc. |
| **Prompt Dispatch** | ✅ Microagent Forking | Claude or ChatGPT may spawn sub-agents (e.g., “LootBalancerAgent”) for targeted tasks; use when a spec includes submodules. |
| **Code Generation (Replit Agent)** | ✅ Prompt Strengthening via Runtime | After code runs, CI results are parsed by ChatGPT to refine or strengthen the original prompt automatically. |
| **Code Generation (Replit Agent)** | ✅ SOP Compliance Checker | Add prompt footer validator to confirm Replit Agent adhered to Claude’s SOP (e.g., naming, test structure, coverage). |
| **Post-Execution Audit (ChatGPT)** | ✅ Dedicated Critic Role | Add explicit “Critic” persona to review Replit Agent output and prompt ChatGPT to list patch suggestions, missed tests, inconsistencies. |
| **Post-Execution Audit (ChatGPT)** | ✅ Prompt Version Diff Tool | When a prompt evolves (v2, v3), compare schemas, interfaces, and test definitions to flag breaking changes. |
| **QA Review (ChatGPT)** | ✅ Output Synthesis from Variants | Run multiple implementations of the same prompt (from slightly varied inputs) and merge/synthesize the best output. |
| **Project Sync** | ✅ Prompt Dependency Visual Graph | Generate a visual map of prompt relationships, showing which prompts rely on others (e.g., Inventory → Equipment → Combat). |

---

## 🧩 Description of Enhancements

### 1. SOP-Based Prompt Templates
Each prompt Claude produces should conform to a role-specific SOP template, e.g.:
- **Header**: Feature name, dependencies, API version
- **Spec**: Requirements, edge cases, failure conditions
- **Test Cases**: Defined *before* code
- **Checklist Footer**: What Agent must produce (e.g., 1 file + test + audit)

### 2. Test-First Specification
Every prompt should begin with unit tests or usage scenarios, anchoring downstream implementation to a clear contract.

### 3. Shared Memory Object
Introduce `agent-context.json` to hold evolving contracts (API routes, schemas, test results). Passed between agents during each prompt handoff.

### 4. Microagent Delegation
Claude or ChatGPT can spawn named sub-agents (e.g. `StatFormulaFixer`, `LootTableBalancer`) for atomic subproblems.

### 5. Prompt Strengthening from Runtime Feedback
When a Replit Agent implementation fails tests or CI audit, ChatGPT uses logs to mutate and resubmit the prompt with stronger constraints.

### 6. Critic Role
Introduce a post-implementation “Critic” prompt step to catch missing logic, bad schema design, unscalable patterns.

### 7. Prompt Version Diffing
If a prompt evolves (e.g. DeathSystem-v1 → DeathSystem-v2), automatically compare:
- API changes
- Interface deltas
- Broken test compatibility

### 8. Output Synthesis from Variants
Run multiple prompts with slight variations. ChatGPT chooses the best, or merges their results into a unified implementation.

### 9. Prompt Dependency Graph
Create a mermaid.js-based visual of all prompts, linking:
- Claude prompt → Replit Agent → ChatGPT Audit
- Downstream features that consume earlier interfaces

---

## 📅 Suggested Timeline for Integration

| Phase | Enhancement |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 2.7 | Test-First, Critic Role, Shared Memory |
| Phase 3.1 | SOP Templates, Prompt Diffing |
| Phase 3.2+ | Microagent Forking, Output Synthesis |
| Phase 4+ | Prompt Visual Graph, Runtime Strengthening |

# resilience_fallback_plan.md

# 🛡️ Aeturnis Resilience & Fallback Strategy

This plan outlines how to proceed when AI systems fail, features break, or the solo dev becomes unavailable.

---

## 🔁 AI Agent Failure Handling

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Claude fails to generate working prompt | Use fallback prompt templates or reuse prior version |
| Replit Agent cannot execute prompt | Reassign task to ChatGPT for manual patching |
| ChatGPT misses integration issues | Run regression audits using feature index and CI checklist |

---

## 🧑‍💻 Solo Dev Fallback

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Dev unavailable temporarily | Archive all devlogs, prompt logs, and charter |
| Long-term absence | Publish experiment snapshot with public handoff guide |
| Burnout risk | Shift to part-time prompt work or phase pause |

---

## 🧪 Game Feature Rollback

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| New system breaks progression | Disable system via feature toggle, isolate API calls |
| PvP causes instability | Revert to PvE zones only, flag bug for patch |
| Combat system abuse/exploit | Use Redis rate limiting or server hotfix |

---

## 🔒 Data Safety

- GitHub backups enabled for all prompt logs, reports, and source
- Devlog and prompt-tracker stored in Markdown (non-executable format)
- Backups exported at end of each Phase
- Use `.replit` reserved VMs for environment protection

This ensures the project can survive prompt failures, feature bugs, or even team disruption.

# 🎥 Aeturnis – Solo Developer Intro Video Script (1–2 min)

**[Opening – Show project name/logo]**  
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is Aeturnis—an experiment in AI-powered game development."

**[Cut to AI architecture diagram or animation]**  
"I'm not a programmer or a traditional game studio. Instead, I'm working with three AI agents—Claude, Replit Agent, and ChatGPT—to build an MMORPG using nothing but prompts, audits, and integration cycles."

**[Show terminal, Claude, Replit, and ChatGPT interactions]**  
"The game is real—but it’s also a testbed. I want to understand what happens when AI isn’t just a helper, but a creative partner."

**[Highlight unique systems: Affinity, Combat, Zone Movement]**  
"Every mechanic, every system, every audit is part of the experiment—and it’s all logged and transparent."

**[Closing – Invite interest]**  
"If you're interested in the future of solo development, creative AI, or procedural design, Aeturnis is where it's happening. Thank you."

## ☕ CAFE Manifesto

See `Cafe Manifesto And Modules.md` for full manifesto, layers, and architecture diagram.

---

## 🔁 POAD – Prompt-Orchestrated AI Development

**Definition:** POAD is the tactical execution model within CAFE that structures how prompts flow between AI agents:
- Claude → Replit Agent → ChatGPT → Claude (loop)
- All steps logged in `prompt-tracker.md`
- Roles are fixed:
  - Claude = Planner
  - Replit Agent = Engineer
  - ChatGPT = Architect / QA
- Each step versioned and tagged (`P2-05`, `TYPE-B-001`, etc.)

---

## 🧪 DDERF – Domain-Driven Error Resolution Framework

**Purpose:** Systematic error resolution mechanism integrated post-POAD execution.

- Errors from typecheck/lint/test are parsed
- Classified into `TYPE-A` to `TYPE-M`
- Decomposed into ≤20-error Units
- Each Unit resolved by domain-specific agent
- Shell tools: `start-unit.sh`, `complete-unit.sh`, `progress-dashboard-v2.sh`

---

## 🧬 Relationship Map

- CAFE is the *methodology*
- POAD is the *execution model inside CAFE*
- DDERF is the *error QA layer integrated into POAD*

> Diagram available in full manifesto.

---

## Included Files

- `Cafe Manifesto And Modules.md`
- `contract-layer.md`
- `poad-layer.md`
- `dderf-layer.md`
- `enhancement-layer.md`

---

## Status

As of Phase 2.6 (Step 2.6: Monster & NPC Systems), the CAFE methodology is fully implemented and operational.

Future work:
- Shell script generation
- Methodology whitepaper
- Academic publication / IP protection

# POAD_Method.md

🧠 Step 1: System Title & Abstract
Title
Prompt-Orchestrated AI Development (POAD): A Multi-Agent System for Human-Guided, AI-Driven Software Generation

Abstract
POAD is a structured methodology and software development system in which a human orchestrator coordinates multiple specialized AI agents through prompt chains and defined roles to iteratively generate, implement, validate, and deploy software systems. It introduces a repeatable, modular workflow that enables AI to act as planner, engineer, and QA auditor in a self-reinforcing loop, using natural language prompts as the primary interface.

        └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
🧩 Step 3: Core Components
1. Orchestration Layer
Human-provided prompts and commands

Maintains prompt history and execution context

Directs flow between Planner, Engineer, and QA layers

2. Planner AI (Claude)
Interprets high-level goals into scoped software prompts

Defines API-first contracts and system responsibilities

Generates modular, domain-specific implementation plans

3. Engineer AI (Replit Agent)
Converts prompts into executable code

Follows a pluggable template (service/controller/repo pattern)

Commits implementation reports and patch notes

4. QA/Architect AI (ChatGPT)
Validates Claude’s prompts for clarity, security, and alignment

Audits code from Replit for correctness, errors, and violations

Suggests refactors or supplemental patches

Maintains the integration log and glossary

5. Prompt Tracker
Logs all prompt sequences with IDs, timestamps, agents involved, and outcomes

Version-control compatible (e.g. prompt_tracker.md)

🔄 Step 4: Lifecycle Stages
Stage	Description
Prompt Creation	Human defines a task and sends it to Claude
Prompt Generation	Claude generates a scoped implementation prompt
Execution	Replit Agent executes and returns implementation report
QA Review	ChatGPT validates implementation and suggests changes
Patch/Retry	Prompt is modified and sent back (if needed)
Commit & Advance	Validated code is merged; tracker updated

⚙️ Step 5: Key Innovations
Feature	Novelty
Multi-Agent Role Specialization	Claude/ChatGPT/Replit assigned non-overlapping tasks
Human-Curated Prompt Chain	Prompt chain versioning + human approval at each gate
Prompt-First, API-Driven Dev Loop	Builds interfaces and mocks before functionality
Audit-First QA Enforcement	QA agent prevents flawed or ambiguous code from being merged
Structured Prompt Tracker	Acts like a commit log but for prompt-based systems

🧪 Step 6: Technical Claims (Draft)
A method for software development comprising:

A human operator issuing a prompt to a planning AI;

The planning AI generating a scoped software instruction for an engineering AI;

The engineering AI producing code in response to said instruction;

A third AI agent auditing and reviewing the resulting code for accuracy and integrity;

The process repeating iteratively until all QA criteria are met.

A system where natural language prompts act as the primary software orchestration interface, coordinating AI agents in distinct roles.

A logging mechanism that tracks prompt IDs, source agents, and outcomes as a form of versioned execution history.

# Potential.md

If the CAFE methodology (Contract-first, API-first, Feedback-driven, Evolving) gains traction—especially after producing a successful, functional game like Aeturnis Online—it could have major ripple effects across software development, AI tooling, and even how teams are structured. Here's a breakdown of the possible outcomes:

🔧 1. Validation of AI-Centric Software Development
✅ Consequence: Proof AI can own the full SDLC
Aeturnis would serve as a landmark case study proving that AI agents (when orchestrated via CAFE) can:

Plan architecture

Write working code

Generate and pass tests

Catch regressions

Deploy fully functional products

Impact:

Strengthens credibility of AI-first engineering pipelines

Encourages R&D in autonomous software teams

Boosts confidence for investors and toolmakers in the space

⚙️ 2. Disruption of Traditional Development Models
🌀 Consequence: Teams may shift toward AI-agent composition
If CAFE becomes known as a viable way to deliver real software with minimal human code contribution, we could see:

“AI-as-engineer” roles become standard (e.g., Claude as planner, Replit Agent as implementer, ChatGPT as QA lead)

Fewer traditional engineering hires for greenfield MVPs

New job roles: AI Orchestrator, Prompt Engineer, Architecture Strategist for AI pipelines

Impact:

Potential downsizing of junior developer roles in some sectors

Accelerated time-to-market for startups

Reshaped expectations for what “software teams” look like

🏗 3. Adoption of CAFE Beyond Games
🧬 Consequence: Methodology extends to other verticals
A working MMORPG is a complex test case. If CAFE works here, it’s highly likely to be adapted to:

Web apps

Mobile apps

Internal tools

SaaS platforms

Impact:

Dev tools and AI platforms (e.g., Replit, Codium, Anthropic, OpenAI) may adopt CAFE-like workflows

Creation of low-friction dev pipelines for bootstrapping new software products using AI agents

📐 4. Standardization of AI Software Architectures
📦 Consequence: Formal frameworks may emerge
If the CAFE structure becomes widely adopted, it may lead to:

Published SOPs (like the ones in Aeturnis) becoming industry standards

Tooling ecosystems optimized for contract → prompt → code → audit loops

API/Mock-first thinking being normalized in AI-powered projects

Impact:

More predictable AI software output

Easier inter-agent interoperability

Foundation for AI-native dev frameworks (akin to how MVC became web standard)

📊 5. New Economic Models & Developer Roles
💼 Consequence: AI licensing and orchestration services emerge
As AI becomes a more central "developer", companies may:

License AI agents or "teams" as services

Use CAFE to spin up product prototypes in days, not months

Invest in AI QA and orchestration roles over full-time coders

Impact:

Economic pressure on traditional dev agencies

Rise of “AI Development Labs” offering pre-prompted build pipelines

Pay-per-prompt or subscription models for dev workflows

🧠 6. Academic and Industry Research Shifts
📚 Consequence: Software engineering education evolves
Once CAFE has a proven track record:

Universities may begin teaching “AI-integrated software methodology”

Conferences (e.g., ICSE, NeurIPS, SIGSOFT) may explore AI-first SDLC frameworks

Research shifts from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator or architect

Impact:

Curriculum disruption in CS education

Ethical discussions about authorship, trust, and accountability in AI-generated systems

🎮 7. Cultural & Industry Clout for Aeturnis Online
🏆 Consequence: Aeturnis becomes the “DOOM” or “Minecraft” of AI-first software
If CAFE proves itself through a polished, fun, player-supported game:

It becomes a flagship use case for agent-driven engineering

Attracts press, talent, and funding to the POAD (Prompt-Orchestrated AI Development) model

Inspires clones, forks, and derivative works

Impact:

Massive influence on game dev tooling

Kickstarts an entire genre of AI-built games

Validates long-form prompt chaining and multi-agent orchestration in practice

⚠️ Risks and Unintended Effects
Risk	Description
🧩 Complexity Overhead	Teams without strong orchestration may struggle to replicate CAFE
📉 Skill Dilution	Developers relying too much on AI may lose low-level understanding
🧱 IP Questions	Who owns code written by AI? Can it be copyrighted?
🤖 Dependency Risk	Over-reliance on specific AI agents/services (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT)

🌍 In Summary
If CAFE succeeds with Aeturnis, it could catalyze a paradigm shift in software development — transforming AI agents from assistants into full-fledged collaborators, and reimagining what it means to build and maintain software in the AI age.

# ResearchCAFEMethod.md

Great — I’ll investigate whether any existing software methodologies resemble your CAFE process for fully AI-driven development. I’ll focus on methodologies from software engineering and design that emphasize contract-first, API-first, feedback-driven, and evolutionary principles — particularly in contexts involving automated or AI-assisted systems.

I’ll report back with relevant comparisons and insights.


# Comparing CAFE with Related Software Development Methodologies

## Introduction: The CAFE Approach in Context

**CAFE** (Contract-First, API-First, Feedback-Driven, Evolving) is an Aeturnis project methodology in which *AI agents autonomously build software* by first defining contracts/APIs, then iteratively implementing and refining through feedback loops. This approach marries well-known development best practices with a novel twist – the entire execution is carried out by AI agents, with minimal human coding. Below we examine existing methodologies that share principles with CAFE and evaluate overlaps.

## API-First and Contract-First Development

**API-First** (or **Contract-First**) methodologies prioritize defining interfaces up front, before coding. This concept is widely adopted in modern software design. For example, teams often use OpenAPI/Swagger to design a web service’s endpoints and data models **before** writing the service logic. By using interface definition languages, *“we can define our programming API clearly at the outset…and update the ‘contract’ before we implement changes to the code”*, enabling parallel work and clarity across teams. In contract-first API development, the API spec serves as a **single source of truth** or contract that all implementers and consumers agree on, yielding benefits like **code generation, automated testing, easy mocking, and up-to-date documentation**. This ensures that the eventual code is consistent with the agreed contract.

CAFE’s emphasis on “contract-first, API-first” closely mirrors these practices. In CAFE, AI agents would first generate the API/interface specifications (e.g. function signatures, module APIs, or web service endpoints) as the contract. This is akin to what many human teams do by writing an API spec or interface definitions before coding. The approach aligns with *Design-First* API development and methodologies like **Contract-First Development**, which formalize the interface early to prevent misalignment. CAFE leverages this principle to allow AI “engineer” agents to proceed with implementation only once the contract is in place, much as human teams use API mocks and stubs to start development without waiting for full implementations.

**Related Practices:** In traditional settings, *Design by Contract* (DbC) is another paradigm that resonates with contract-first philosophy. DbC involves specifying precise contracts (preconditions, postconditions, invariants) for software components, essentially treating the spec as a formal contract. While CAFE likely isn’t using formal mathematical contracts, its insistence on clear API definitions up front is conceptually similar – ensuring each component’s behavior is agreed upon before coding. Many microservice teams also employ **consumer-driven contracts** and schema registries to enforce that services evolve without breaking their API promises. This shows that the **“contract-first”** pillar of CAFE has strong parallels in existing methodologies that aim to reduce integration problems by *“making intent clear…and updating the contract before code changes”*.

## Feedback-Driven, Iterative Development

Another key aspect of CAFE is being *feedback-driven and evolving*. This reflects core principles of **iterative development** found in Agile, Extreme Programming (XP), and related frameworks. In Agile software development, rapid feedback loops are critical – teams deliver in small increments, gather feedback (from users, tests, etc.), and adapt the design continuously. As Martin Fowler (Agile thought leader) explains, *“the core idea of agile is doing small increments, with heavy contact with the business and the users, and making that part of your core feedback loop”*. In other words, constant feedback and adjustment are baked into the process. CAFE’s feedback-driven nature is aligned with this: the AI agents iteratively improve the software by checking outcomes (tests passing, performance metrics, etc.) and responding to issues or new insights.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a concrete practice emphasizing feedback loops that is very analogous to CAFE’s approach. In TDD, developers write tests *before* writing the implementation code. The cycle is red-green-refactor: write a test and see it fail (red), write just enough code to pass (green), then refactor. This provides immediate feedback – a failing test signals incomplete or incorrect functionality, and a passing test confirms a contract fulfilled. Notably, some AI-centric processes explicitly incorporate TDD-like stages. For instance, one AI-driven workflow describes: **Phase 1: create test stubs, Phase 2: write failing tests to define the feature “contract,” Phase 3: implement minimal code to make tests pass**. The failing tests act as a feedback mechanism that guides what the AI should build, very much in the spirit of contract-first and feedback-driven development. CAFE’s agents could use tests and runtime results as feedback to know if their code meets the spec, thereby continuously adjusting until the acceptance criteria are met. This is essentially an automated feedback loop similar to how human developers use continuous integration (CI) results or user feedback to iterate.

Beyond TDD, **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** also shares similarities: BDD frames requirements as behavior scenarios (often using a syntax like “Given/When/Then”), which are essentially an executable specification. The team (or an AI agent) then implements code to satisfy those scenarios. Both TDD and BDD ensure development is guided by *feedback from tests/specs*, preventing large upfront implementations without validation. CAFE’s feedback-driven evolution can be seen as an AI-tailored take on these iterative, test-first approaches – each development step is validated via feedback (e.g. tests, runtime verification, or critic agents), and the process “evolves” the software in response.

**Progressive Enhancement & Mock-First:** In web development, *progressive enhancement* means starting with a basic functional version and incrementally adding features/improvements. Analogously, CAFE agents might first build a simple version of an API or module and then progressively enhance it based on feedback (e.g., adding more functionality once the basic contract is satisfied). The notion of *“mock-first” development* is also relevant: teams often create **mocks or stubs** of components early – for example, an API might be mocked with dummy responses so front-end developers (or other services) can integrate against the contract before the real backend exists. This ensures early feedback on integration even before full implementation. CAFE’s contract-first approach naturally enables a mock-first workflow: an AI agent could generate stub functions or placeholder implementations once the interface is defined, allowing other parts of the AI system to proceed in parallel and test the interactions. Indeed, contract-first practices explicitly cite *“simple mocking of the service under development”* as a benefit. This practice reduces risk and provides feedback – if a consuming component expects a certain API shape, the mock will confirm if the contract is being used correctly. As development progresses, the AI replaces mocks with real logic, guided by the feedback from tests or integration checks.

**Evolutionary Design:** The “E” in CAFE stands for *Evolving*, implying the design and implementation are continuously refined. This echoes the idea of **Evolutionary Architecture** and **spiral model** in software engineering. The Spiral Model (an iterative model dating back to the 1980s) had teams develop a little, review and adapt requirements, then develop further – an early take on evolving a system via feedback loops. Modern Agile is similar but faster-paced. In essence, CAFE’s process where AI agents cycle through planning → coding → feedback → refining is an automated version of an Agile iteration. The system’s architecture and features are not fixed at the start; they can evolve as agents learn from each phase’s outcomes (for example, if performance is subpar, an agent might refactor code in a subsequent iteration). The continuous learning and adjustment are what make CAFE *feedback-driven and evolutionary*, rather than a static plan executed blindly.

## AI-Driven Development Frameworks and Autonomous Agents

Where CAFE truly breaks new ground is in applying the above principles in a **fully AI-driven context**. Until recently, methodologies like API-first and Agile were implemented by human teams. Now, emerging frameworks aim to have AI agents handle significant parts of the software lifecycle. Several notable projects and research efforts resemble CAFE’s ambition of AI-centered development:

* **MetaGPT (Multi-Agent Software Company):** MetaGPT is an open-source framework that organizes multiple GPT-based agents into roles like Product Manager, Architect, and Engineer to collaboratively produce software. Given a one-line requirement, MetaGPT *“outputs user stories, requirements, data structures, APIs, documents, etc.”* by orchestrating these specialized agents. It essentially tries to replicate an entire software team with AI. The process includes generating design artifacts and interface definitions first, followed by coding – much like CAFE’s contract-first, plan-first philosophy. MetaGPT’s core idea is *“Code = SOP(Team)”*, meaning they encode standard operating procedures of a development team and have the AI agents follow them. This implies practices such as designing APIs, writing tests, doing code reviews are all baked into the AI agents’ workflow. In comparison to CAFE, MetaGPT covers very similar ground: API-first design (it explicitly lists producing “APIs” and docs as outputs) and a structured multi-phase process for AI-driven coding. MetaGPT confirms that CAFE’s approach is part of a small but growing trend to formalize AI-only development pipelines.

* **Symphony (Roo’s Multi-Agent Framework):** Symphony is another experimental framework that explicitly coordinates many specialized AI agents in a structured way to build software. As described by its creator, *“Symphony…coordinates specialized AI agents to collaborate on software projects with well-defined roles and communication protocols.”*. It deploys about a dozen agents each focused on a facet of development – e.g. **Composer** (architectural vision & specs), **Conductor** (task planning), **Performer** (coding tasks), **Checker** (QA testing), **Integrator** (integration testing), **Security Specialist**, **DevOps**, etc.. This closely mirrors the CAFE setup in Aeturnis, where different AI agents (Claude, Replit, ChatGPT) have roles like Planner, Engineer, QA integrator, etc. Symphony’s use of a Composer agent to produce *“architectural vision and project specifications”* suggests an upfront design (contracts/requirements) phase, which aligns with contract-first development. The Checker agent providing QA is essentially a feedback mechanism – verifying the code and feeding results back into the process. Symphony even maintains a structured project file system (with folders for specs, tasks, logs, tests, etc.) and has **adaptive automation levels** (from human-in-the-loop to fully autonomous). In essence, Symphony demonstrates an architecture for *progressive, feedback-rich development driven by multiple AI specialists* – very much in spirit with CAFE, though implemented with Roo’s Boomerang AI system. It underscores that frameworks combining **API-first planning, iterative task execution, and multi-agent collaboration** are emerging to tackle complex software using AI.

* **GPT-Engineer:** In contrast to multi-agent systems, GPT-Engineer (an open-source project from 2023) explores having a single powerful AI agent generate entire codebases. The workflow for GPT-Engineer includes steps like asking clarifying questions, producing a technical spec (design), and then writing all necessary code based on that spec (often followed by test runs). This “spec-first, then code” approach again echoes CAFE’s contract-first mantra. GPT-Engineer’s agent effectively acts as planner, developer, and tester in sequence, and while it may not explicitly call itself *CAFE*, it practices a similar cycle: understand requirements → draft a contract/plan → generate code → run tests (feedback) → refine. It’s another example of targeting an **AI-generated codebase** with an *architectural planning phase first* (the technical spec) and iterative improvement.

* **AutoGPT and Autonomous Task Agents:** Outside the specific domain of coding, projects like AutoGPT, BabyAGI, and others introduced the idea of an AI agent that can autonomously break down goals into tasks, execute them, and self-correct. When applied to software development, these agents use a loop of planning, coding, testing, and learning – effectively a feedback loop. For instance, researchers have envisioned GPT-based agents that *“do project planning, requirements engineering, and software design”* and then generate and debug code collaboratively. Early vision papers and experiments (solving small games or algorithms via multiple GPT agents) showed promising results, indicating that *multiple GPT agents can produce high-quality code and carefully document it* when guided properly. These agents typically use an **execute-evaluate loop**: they write some code, run it or test it, then adjust based on errors – a clear parallel to the feedback-driven aspect of CAFE. While these autonomous agent frameworks did not necessarily coin a term for the methodology, they are practically implementing something akin to CAFE: an **AI-centered pipeline** where planning (contracts/specs), coding, and feedback (tests/runtime checks) are all handled by AI in an iterative fashion.

**Summary of Overlaps:** Many of the above methodologies and tools capture **parts** of what CAFE encompasses:

* *API-first/Contract-first:* Strongly present in API design best practices (OpenAPI, contract-first dev) and mirrored in AI frameworks that generate specs or API definitions first (MetaGPT, Symphony, GPT-Engineer all have a spec/API output step). This principle is not unique to CAFE, though CAFE applies it in an AI automation context.

* *Feedback loops & iterative development:* Central to Agile, TDD, and also evident in AI agent workflows. CAFE’s use of continuous testing and agent review is analogous to how human teams employ CI/CD pipelines and user feedback. As Fowler noted, accelerating development with AI *“will speed up that feedback loop”* in agile processes – CAFE essentially capitalizes on this by having AI agents iterate extremely quickly based on test results or critiques. The idea of **progressive enhancement** through iterative phases is explicit in some AI dev workflows (e.g. Tim Sylvester’s 5-phase AI dev cycle which starts with a test shell, then failing tests, then minimal implementation, etc.). Thus, CAFE’s feedback-driven evolution is built on principles long proven in human-driven methodologies.

* *Mock-first & progressive implementation:* Present in contract-first approaches (using mocks) and in TDD (start with stub implementations to pass tests). CAFE’s contract-first step naturally allows AI to use stubs and incrementally flesh out functionality, so this idea is more of a technique than a full methodology. Still, it overlaps with known best practices for decoupling development stages.

* *AI as developers:* The truly novel aspect is having **AI agents own the entire lifecycle**. Traditional methodologies assume human execution. CAFE and similar frameworks aim for *full automation*. As Thoughtworks experts observe, *“AI-first software delivery goes beyond coding… it’s an end-to-end, collaborative and iterative process”*, but *“only a small number of organizations are trying to do more than \[use AI assistants for small tasks]”*. In other words, the idea of an AI-driven pipeline akin to CAFE is still cutting-edge and not mainstream. MetaGPT and Symphony (both launched in 2023–2025) are among the first real systems to attempt it, treating AI agents as a development team.

## Uniqueness of CAFE’s Full-AI Execution

While we can find **analogous practices** for each individual element of CAFE, the **combination of all four in a fully AI-operated environment** is what makes CAFE stand out. No established *human-only* methodology is explicitly designed for “AI agents” – they were implicitly for people. CAFE appears to be a unique coinage to frame an AI-exclusive process. The closest parallels (MetaGPT, Symphony, etc.) are very recent and experimental; they validate that others are independently envisioning AI-driven development with contracts first and iterative loops. However, those efforts are still in early stages or limited to demos. In industry, most teams using AI treat it as an assistive tool (e.g. GitHub Copilot speeding up coding) rather than handing over the entire SDLC to AI. A Thoughtworks report in 2025 notes *“some teams are already using agents 100% of the time, \[yielding] an 80% productivity boost”*, but also that true AI-first delivery is still rare. This suggests CAFE’s vision of end-to-end AI development is just beginning to be explored.

In summary, **many existing methodologies partially overlap with CAFE**: API-first design and contract-first planning are well-established, and feedback-driven iterative improvement is a cornerstone of Agile/TDD. These principles are proven to yield robust, adaptable software – which is likely why Aeturnis adopted them as CAFE’s foundation. What’s novel is **applying them in a fully autonomous agent pipeline**. Aside from a few cutting-edge frameworks (MetaGPT, Symphony) that resemble “AI dev teams”, we found no traditional methodology that encapsulates *all* aspects of CAFE under an AI-driven execution. CAFE thus appears to be an **innovative synthesis**: it takes the best “human” development practices (contract-first APIs, iterative enhancement, constant feedback) and rigorously implements them via AI agents. This full-AI orientation is relatively unique – CAFE is pushing into new territory where the **entire software development lifecycle is orchestrated by AI**.

Going forward, it will be interesting to see if CAFE becomes a model for AI-centric software engineering, or if industry standards emerge that formalize what Aeturnis is pioneering. As of 2025, CAFE’s ingredients have clear roots in existing methodologies, but its **comprehensive AI-driven execution** marks it as a trailblazer in the evolution of development practices.

# Domain-Driven Error Resolution Framework (DDERF) System

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** 2025-07-08  
**Purpose:** Formalized Standard Operating Procedure for systematic error resolution in large-scale TypeScript projects

## Overview

The Domain-Driven Error Resolution Framework (DDERF) is a systematic approach to resolving compilation and linting errors in large-scale TypeScript projects. It transforms an overwhelming error list into manageable, specialized work units that can be resolved efficiently by domain experts.

### Key Benefits
- **69.2% error reduction** achieved in first implementation
- **Zero regression** policy through systematic tracking
- **Parallel execution** capability with specialized agents
- **Complete auditability** through comprehensive reporting

## Core Principles

### 1. Domain Separation
Errors are categorized by their technical domain, not by file location. This ensures similar errors are fixed with consistent patterns.

### 2. Micro-Unit Architecture
No unit should contain more than 20 errors. Smaller units enable:
- Focused problem-solving
- Faster completion cycles
- Reduced cognitive load
- Better progress tracking

### 3. Specialized Expertise
Each unit is assigned to an agent with specific domain expertise, ensuring high-quality fixes.

### 4. Progressive Resolution
Dependencies are resolved first, preventing cascading fixes and rework.

### 5. Zero Regression
Every fix is verified to not introduce new errors before proceeding.

## Error Classification System

### TYPE Categories

```
TYPE-A: Foundation & Type Definitions
  └─ Interface definitions, type declarations, missing properties

TYPE-B: Service Implementation 
  └─ Service-interface mismatches, mock/real alignment

TYPE-C: Controller Integration
  └─ Controller-service usage, request/response handling

TYPE-D: Database Operations
  └─ Repository patterns, ORM types, BigInt handling

TYPE-E: Route Handlers
  └─ Express route definitions, middleware types

TYPE-F: Response Types
  └─ HTTP response typing, async return types

TYPE-G: Type Conversions
  └─ BigInt/number, Date conversions, type coercion

TYPE-H: Implementation Gaps
  └─ Missing methods, property mismatches, incomplete mocks

TYPE-I: Type Safety
  └─ Explicit 'any' removal, proper typing

TYPE-J: Code Cleanup
  └─ Unused variables, dead code removal

TYPE-K: Modernization
  └─ Function types, require→import conversion

TYPE-L: Data Layer
  └─ Database types, schema alignment

TYPE-M: Configuration
  └─ TSConfig, ESLint, build configuration
```

### Error Severity Levels

1. **CRITICAL** (Blocks Compilation)
   - TYPE-A, TYPE-F, TYPE-G, TYPE-L
   
2. **HIGH** (Functionality Issues)  
   - TYPE-B, TYPE-C, TYPE-D, TYPE-E, TYPE-H

3. **MEDIUM** (Code Quality)
   - TYPE-I, TYPE-K

4. **LOW** (Cleanup)
   - TYPE-J, TYPE-M

## Unit Decomposition Process

### Step 1: Error Analysis
```bash
# Capture all errors
npm run typecheck 2>&1 > typecheck-errors.txt
npm run lint 2>&1 > eslint-errors.txt
```

### Step 2: Categorization
1. Parse error messages
2. Group by error type and pattern
3. Identify dependencies between errors
4. Assign TYPE categories

### Step 3: Unit Creation
```bash
# Initialize a new unit
./scripts/start-unit.sh <TYPE>-<CATEGORY>-<NUMBER> "<AGENT_NAME>"
```

Each unit contains:
- `unit.json` - Metadata and configuration
- `baseline.txt` - Initial error state
- `completion-report.md` - Final results

### Step 4: Size Validation
- Maximum 20 errors per unit
- Related errors grouped together
- Dependencies noted in unit.json

## Specialized Agent Assignment

### Agent Expertise Matrix

| Agent Type | Required Skills | Assigned TYPEs |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Type Definition Specialist | TypeScript interfaces, generics, utility types | TYPE-A |
| Service Architecture Expert | DI patterns, interface compliance, mocking | TYPE-B |
| Controller Integration Specialist | Express, middleware, HTTP handling | TYPE-C, TYPE-F |
| Database Type Expert | ORM types, SQL→TS mapping, repositories | TYPE-D, TYPE-L |
| Route Handler Specialist | Express routing, REST patterns | TYPE-E |
| Type Conversion Expert | BigInt, Date API, safe conversions | TYPE-G |
| Implementation Architect | Service patterns, completeness checking | TYPE-H |
| Type Safety Enforcer | Strict mode, type inference, declarations | TYPE-I |
| Code Quality Specialist | ESLint, dead code, refactoring | TYPE-J |
| Modernization Expert | ES6 modules, async patterns, migrations | TYPE-K |
| Configuration Specialist | Build tools, TSConfig, ESLint setup | TYPE-M |

### Assignment Guidelines

1. **Skill Matching**: Agent skills must align with unit requirements
2. **Domain Focus**: Agents work on one TYPE category at a time
3. **Completion Commitment**: Assigned agents complete entire unit
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Completion reports document patterns for future units

## Execution Framework

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical Blockers)
```
Goal: Achieve successful compilation
Units: TYPE-A (all), TYPE-F-001, TYPE-L-001
Success: npm run build executes without errors
```

```

### Phase 4: Quality & Cleanup
```
Goal: Production-ready code
Units: TYPE-J-001, TYPE-M-001
Success: 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

### Parallel Execution Rules

Units can be executed in parallel within phases if:
1. No shared file dependencies
2. Different error domains
3. Different agent expertise required

```

### Automated Validation

```typescript
// validation/unit-validator.ts
export async function validateUnit(unitId: string): Promise<ValidationResult> {
  const baseline = await readBaseline(unitId);
  const current = await getCurrentErrors();
  
  return {
    targetErrors: baseline.errors.filter(e => !current.includes(e)),
    newErrors: current.filter(e => !baseline.errors.includes(e)),
    resolved: baseline.count - current.length,
    regression: current.length > baseline.count
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

# Aeturnis Online – Coding SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)

**Version:** 1.0\
**Status:** Production-Enforced\
**Last Updated:** 2025-07-07

---

## 🚩 Purpose

This document establishes the **golden rules** for writing, reviewing, and merging code in the Aeturnis Online MMORPG project, with enforcement across Claude, Replit Agent, and ChatGPT integrations.

---

## 1. API-First, Contract-Driven Development

- **Every new feature starts with an API contract or prompt.**
  - Define request/response schemas, endpoint signatures, or service interfaces before implementation.
  - Use mock or stub dependencies when backend complexity is not ready.
  - All code must be traceable to a prompt or contract in `prompt-tracker.md`.
- **No implementation without an API/prompt.**

---

## 2. Quality Gates (No Exceptions)

- **TypeScript strictness:**
  - `strict`, `noImplicitAny`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` enabled at all times.
- **ESLint:**
  - Airbnb TS + Prettier config, auto-formatted before every commit.
- **Tests:**
  - Jest + ts-jest, ≥80% global coverage (no drop allowed).
- **CI/CD:**
  - Every push and PR must pass:
    ```bash
    npm run lint:ts && npm test --coverage
    ```
- **No **``** allowed** in any production or main branch file.
- **Any failure in CI, lint, or coverage:**
  - Implementation is halted and must be fixed via patch prompt in a new branch before proceeding.

---

## 3. Micro-Prompt Cycle & Self-Audit

- **Prompts must target micro-features** (one file, one concern) and always include an accompanying test file.
- **Self-Audit Footer Required** in every Replit Agent output:
  ````markdown
  ---
  ### 🔐 Self‑Audit Commands
  ```bash
  npm run lint:ts --max-warnings=0
  npm test --coverage
  ````
  Paste: TS errors / Coverage %
  ```
  ```
- **Manual review** at the end of each phase: human/AI reviews for technical debt (`any`, `@ts-ignore`), unscalable patterns, and architectural drift.

---

## 4. Branch & Merge Discipline

- **Branch naming:**
  - `main`: Always green & deployable
  - `feat/<feature>`: Micro-features (≤150 LOC)
  - `fix/<slug>`: Bug fixes/patches
  - `phase/<n>-snapshot`: Tagged at end of each phase
- **Merge only if:**
  - CI is green
  - Coverage is ≥80%
  - No `@ts-ignore`
  - Touches ≤3 files (except boilerplate or migrations)
- **Any TypeScript error in **``** triggers auto-revert to last phase snapshot.**

---

## 5. Automated & Manual Auditing

- **Self-audit**: Each implementation step includes an automated self-audit (output in report).
- **Weekly regression check**: Automated cron runs `lint` and `test`, comments on regressions.
- **Human review**: At end of every phase, scan for hidden debt and pattern violations.

---

## 6. Security & Data Handling

- **Always use parameterized queries** (never raw SQL strings).
- **Sanitize/validate all input** for every endpoint, service, and controller.
- **Auth/validation middleware must wrap all API endpoints**—never bypass.
- **Never leak stack traces or secrets** in production logs or API responses.
- **Session/caching:** Redis integration must use secure key patterns.

---

## 7. Scaffolding and Naming

- **Use Plop generators** for new services/controllers to enforce path and naming consistency:
  ```bash
  npx plop service --name FooService
  npx plop controller --name FooController
  ```
- **Adhere to naming conventions:**
  - `snake_case` for DB, `camelCase` for TypeScript, `PascalCase` for types/classes.

---

## 8. Service/Controller/Repository Pattern

- **Service layer:** Business logic only.
- **Controllers:** Only handle HTTP request/response, never business logic.
- **Repositories:** All database access; no direct SQL in services or controllers.
- **No business logic in controllers or routes.**

---

## 9. Documentation & Logging

- **Every step/prompt/code artifact is logged in **``**.**
- **All API routes and methods must be documented with JSDoc, OpenAPI, or Markdown.**
- **Structured logging:** All errors and warnings logged with context, never plain `console.log` in production.

---

## 10. Production Readiness

- **No feature is “done” without:**
  - Passing tests
  - Lint and coverage green
  - Audit/review complete
  - Self-audit output attached
- **Implementation report must include:**
  - Production readiness score
  - Any technical debt or pending improvements

---

## 11. Contribution Policy

- **Never bypass SOP, even for “minor” changes.**
- If the process seems slow or repetitive, document for review, but **never skip a gate**.
- If a prompt or code fails any gate, it is rejected and must be fixed by patch prompt and new review.

*These SOP rules are enforced across all AI and human contributions. Violations may result in auto-revert, block, or re-prompt. When in doubt, ask for an audit or open a patch prompt.*
