# TYPE-A-004: Tutorial and Affinity Type Definition Fix Summary

## Issue
The codebase had missing type definitions for Tutorial and Affinity systems, causing test failures and compilation errors.

## Root Cause
- The TypeScript source files in `/packages/shared/types/` were missing for `tutorial.types.ts` and `affinity.types.ts`
- Only the compiled `.d.ts` and `.js` files existed, but not the source `.ts` files
- There were also inconsistencies between the types expected by the tests and the actual type definitions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created `/packages/shared/types/tutorial.types.ts`
- Added all required interfaces, enums, and types for the tutorial system
- Included key enums: `TutorialDifficulty`, `TutorialUrgency`, `TutorialObjectiveType`, `TutorialRewardType`, `TutorialHelpCategory`
- Added request/response DTOs for tutorial operations

### 2. Created `/packages/shared/types/affinity.types.ts`  
- Added all required interfaces, enums, and types for the affinity system
- Included key enums: `WeaponType`, `MagicSchool`, `AffinityRank`, `AffinityBonusType`, `AffinityUsageContext`, `AffinityRewardType`
- Added request/response DTOs for affinity tracking operations

### 3. Fixed Import Paths
- Updated test imports to use direct relative paths to the type files
- Fixed `/packages/shared/types/index.ts` to remove non-existent character.types export

## Results
- ✅ All Tutorial tests now pass (25/25)
- ✅ Most Affinity tests pass (20/22) - 2 failures are logic issues, not type issues
- ✅ Resolved all "Cannot find module" errors related to tutorial.types and affinity.types
- ✅ Fixed undefined enum errors (TutorialDifficulty, TutorialUrgency, AffinityRank, etc.)

## Remaining Issues (Outside Scope)
- 2 Affinity test failures related to level calculation logic
- Database connection module errors
- Character types missing from shared package

The type definition errors for Tutorial and Affinity systems have been successfully resolved.
