# TYPE-G-002: Test File BigInt Conversions Completion Report

**Agent**: BigInt Conversion Specialist  
**Started**: 2025-07-09  
**Completed**: 2025-07-09  

## Summary

Fixed BigInt/number conversion errors and type mismatches in service files. While the unit was originally targeted at test files, the actual errors found were in production service files that affected both runtime and test execution.

## Errors Fixed

### Before
- **TypeScript Errors**: 51
- **Target**: BigInt conversion errors in test files

### After  
- **TypeScript Errors**: 46
- **Errors Fixed**: 5

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed CharacterService updateResources Method (3 instances)
- **File**: `src/services/CharacterService.ts`
- **Issue**: Type 'bigint' is not assignable to type 'number' when updating resources
- **Fix**: Added Number() conversion for bigint parameters:
  ```typescript
  // Before
  if (hp !== undefined) resources.currentHp = hp;
  if (mp !== undefined) resources.currentMp = mp;
  if (stamina !== undefined) resources.currentStamina = stamina;
  
  // After
  if (hp !== undefined) resources.currentHp = Number(hp);
  if (mp !== undefined) resources.currentMp = Number(mp);
  if (stamina !== undefined) resources.currentStamina = Number(stamina);
  ```

### 2. Fixed BankService formatBankSlots Method
- **File**: `src/services/BankService.ts`
- **Issue**: Type mismatch - returning string for itemId when number expected
- **Fix**: Changed from String conversion to proper null handling:
  ```typescript
  // Before
  itemId: slot.itemId ? String(slot.itemId) : null,
  
  // After
  itemId: slot.itemId !== null ? slot.itemId : undefined,
  ```

### 3. Fixed BankService Import Error
- **File**: `src/services/BankService.ts`
- **Issue**: CacheService has no exported member 'cacheService'
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed invalid import
  - Created CacheService instance locally
  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { CacheService, cacheService } from './CacheService';
  
  // After
  import { CacheService } from './CacheService';
  const cacheService = new CacheService({...});
  ```

## Technical Details

### BigInt to Number Conversions
- All conversions use explicit Number() casting
- Safe for resource values (HP, MP, Stamina) that are within JavaScript's safe integer range
- Maintains compatibility with database storage expectations

### Type Safety Improvements
- Fixed type mismatches between optional properties
- Properly handled null vs undefined distinctions
- Ensured consistent typing across service boundaries

## Impact

- Reduced TypeScript errors by 10% (51 â†’ 46)
- Fixed critical service method type mismatches
- Improved runtime safety for resource updates
- Resolved import errors that prevented compilation

## Deviations from Original Scope

The unit was originally intended to fix BigInt conversions in test files, but the actual errors found were in production service files. This is likely because:
1. Test file errors were already fixed in previous units
2. The service file errors were causing both compilation and test failures
3. The error patterns matched the unit's target (BigInt/number conversions)

## Recommendations

1. Consider using a consistent approach for BigInt handling across the codebase
2. Create utility functions for safe BigInt to number conversions
3. Review all service methods that accept BigInt parameters
4. Ensure test files properly mock BigInt values when testing services

## Test Status
- Tests still failing (94 failures) - primarily due to mock/implementation mismatches
- No new test failures introduced by these changes
