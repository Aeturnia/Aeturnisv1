## Summary
Unit TYPE-M-003 focused on updating ESLint configurations to implement environment-specific console rules and proper file-type overrides across the monorepo.

## Files Modified
1. `/packages/server/.eslintrc.js` - Added environment-specific rules and overrides
2. `/packages/shared/.eslintrc.js` - Added strict no-console rule
3. `/.eslintrc.js` - Created root configuration for monorepo consistency
