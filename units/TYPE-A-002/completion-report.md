# TYPE-A-002 Completion Report

**Unit ID:** TYPE-A-002  
**Agent:** Type Definition Agent  
**Date:** 2025-07-07  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Files Modified:** 5  

## Summary
- **Errors Fixed:** 4 monster type definition errors
- **New Errors Revealed:** 0
- **Total Error Count:** 535 → 531 (-4)

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Created Server-Specific Monster Types
- ✅ Created new `src/types/monster.types.ts` file
- ✅ Extended shared Monster interface with server-specific properties
- ✅ Maintained compatibility with shared types

### 2. Added Missing Properties
- ✅ Added `currentHealth?: number` (runtime state)
- ✅ Added `baseHealth?: number` (max health)
- ✅ Added `displayName?: string` (UI display name)
- ✅ Added `name?: string` (monster identifier)

### 3. Updated Import Paths
- ✅ IMonsterService now imports from local types
- ✅ MockMonsterService updated to use extended types
- ✅ RealMonsterService updated to use extended types

### 4. Enhanced Mock Implementation
- ✅ Mock methods now return properly typed Monster objects
- ✅ Removed `any` type from getMonsterById return
- ✅ All mock data includes extended properties

## Quality Checks
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in modified type files
- ✅ No new ESLint violations introduced
- ✅ All existing imports still work
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Self-audit requirements met

## Architecture Decision

Created a server-specific Monster interface that extends the shared one, rather than modifying the shared types. This approach:
- Preserves shared type contract
- Allows server-specific runtime properties
- Maintains clean separation of concerns
- Enables future divergence if needed

## Comparison with TYPE-A-001

| Metric | TYPE-A-001 | TYPE-A-002 |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Duration | 78 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Errors Fixed | 50 | 4 |
| New Errors | +124 | 0 |
| Complexity | High | Low |

TYPE-A-002 was simpler because:
- Smaller scope (only Monster types)
- No interface alignment issues
- Clear property additions
- No hidden implementation errors

## Next Steps
- Proceed to TYPE-A-003 (Movement Types)
- Fix Direction export issue
- Expected to be even simpler (1 line fix)
