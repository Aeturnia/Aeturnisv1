# TYPE-D-006: Mock Service - Method Implementation Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed import path issues and type synchronization problems in mock services. All mock services now properly implement their interfaces.

## Impact
- **TypeScript Errors**: 131 → 125 (6 errors fixed)
- **ESLint Errors**: 71 → 71 (maintained)

## Changes Made

### 1. Import Path Fixes
- **MockTutorialService.ts**: Changed `@shared/types/tutorial.types` to `@aeturnis/shared`
- **MockAffinityService.ts**: Changed `@shared/types/affinity.types` to `@aeturnis/shared`
- Resolved module resolution errors that were preventing services from loading

### 2. Type Synchronization
- **tutorial.types.d.ts**: Updated compiled type definitions to match source
- Added missing exports for:
  - `TutorialHelpMessage`
  - `TutorialDifficulty`
  - `TutorialUrgency`
  - Other tutorial-related types

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- **MockProgressionService.ts**: Removed unused imports (`CharacterStats`, `StatType`)
- **MockTutorialService.ts**: Fixed unused `context` parameter by prefixing with underscore

### 4. Mock Service Verification
- Confirmed MockMonsterService has `getSpawnPointsByZone` method properly implemented
- All mock services now correctly implement their respective interfaces
- No missing methods found

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/mock/MockTutorialService.ts`
   - Fixed import path
   - Fixed unused parameter
   
2. `src/services/mock/MockAffinityService.ts`
   - Fixed import path
   
3. `src/services/mock/MockProgressionService.ts`
   - Removed unused imports
   
4. `packages/shared/dist/types/tutorial.types.d.ts`
   - Synchronized with source types

## Key Patterns Applied
1. **Consistent Import Paths**: All imports now use `@aeturnis/shared` package name
2. **Type Definition Sync**: Ensured compiled `.d.ts` files match source `.ts` files
3. **Clean Code**: Removed unused imports and fixed unused parameters

## Technical Details
The main issues were import path inconsistencies where mock services were trying to import from `@shared/types/...` instead of the correct `@aeturnis/shared` package. This was causing module resolution failures in tests and runtime.

## Next Steps
- Continue with TYPE-D-007 for shared types path resolution
- Consider automating the build process to keep .d.ts files in sync
- Review other services for similar import path issues
