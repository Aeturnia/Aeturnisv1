# TYPE-E-002: Character Routes - Request/Response Flow

## Overview
Fix request/response flow issues in character routes, focusing on proper return statements, error handling, and validation.

## Current Issues

### 1. Missing Return Statements
While most routes have proper returns, need to verify all error paths return properly.

### 2. Test Failures
Many character route tests are failing with 404 errors when expecting other status codes:
- GET requests returning 404 instead of expected 200
- POST requests returning 404 instead of expected 201/400
- This suggests routes may not be properly registered or middleware issues

### 3. Validation Responses
Need to ensure validation errors return proper status codes and response formats.

## Tasks
1. Fix missing return statements after res.json()
2. Debug why routes are returning 404 (routing or middleware issue)
3. Ensure proper error status codes
4. Add request validation middleware where missing
5. Fix character ownership checks

## Files to Review
- `/packages/server/src/routes/character.routes.ts` - Main character routes
- `/packages/server/src/middleware/auth.ts` - Already fixed in TYPE-E-001
- `/packages/server/src/services/CharacterService.ts` - Service implementation
- `/packages/server/src/__tests__/routes/character.routes.test.ts` - Tests showing failures

## Success Criteria
- All character route tests pass
- Proper HTTP status codes returned
- No missing return statements
- Consistent error response format
