# Combat Service Fix Summary (TYPE-B-001)

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Type Definitions (combat.types.ts)
- Added missing `DamageType` enum export
- Added `currentTurnIndex` property to `CombatSession` interface (alias for `currentTurn`)
- Moved imports to top of file (fixed import order issue)

### 2. Interface (ICombatService.ts)
- Removed external dependency on `@aeturnis/shared` for `DamageType`
- Now imports `DamageType` from local `combat.types.ts`
- Added `DamageType` to exports

### 3. MockCombatService Implementation
- Complete rewrite to use new `Combatant` type consistently
- Fixed type mismatches between legacy and new types
- Added proper type conversions for buff/debuff effects
- Implemented all required interface methods
- Added support for both new and legacy methods (optional)
- Fixed imports to include `CombatActionType` and `CombatBuff`

### 4. RealCombatService Implementation
- Simplified to delegate to actual `CombatService`
- Removed complex type mapping logic
- Implemented stub methods that return appropriate responses
- Fixed method signatures to match interface

### 5. Combat Controller
- Fixed service type casting for `MonsterService`
- Removed references to non-existent static methods
- Added fallback implementations for missing services

## Key Changes

1. **Type Consistency**: All services now use the same `Combatant` and `CombatSession` types
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Added `currentTurnIndex` as an alias for `currentTurn`
3. **Import Organization**: Fixed circular dependencies and import order issues
4. **Error Handling**: Added proper error responses for unimplemented methods

## Verification

All TypeScript errors in the combat-related files have been resolved:
- `src/types/combat.types.ts` ✓
- `src/providers/interfaces/ICombatService.ts` ✓
- `src/providers/mock/MockCombatService.ts` ✓
- `src/providers/real/RealCombatService.ts` ✓
- `src/controllers/combat.controller.ts` ✓

## Next Steps

1. The RealCombatService needs proper session tracking implementation
2. Consider removing legacy interface methods if not needed
3. Implement proper database queries in RealCombatService methods
4. Add unit tests for all combat service implementations
