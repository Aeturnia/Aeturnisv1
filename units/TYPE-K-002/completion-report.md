# TYPE-K-002 Completion Report

## Unit Information
- **Unit ID**: TYPE-K-002
- **Type**: Convert Require to Import
- **Agent**: System Analysis Agent
- **Date**: 2025-07-09

## Summary

No TYPE-K specific errors were found in the codebase. All require() statements have already been converted to ES6 imports, and no Function type usage was detected.

## Investigation Details

### 1. Searched for require() statements
```bash
grep -r "require\s*\(" packages/server/src/
```
**Result**: No files found with require() statements

### 2. Searched for Function type usage
```bash
grep -r ":\s*Function\b" packages/server/src/
```
**Result**: No files found using the Function type

### 3. Reviewed baseline errors and lint output
- **TypeScript errors**: 40 errors found, but none related to TYPE-K issues
- **ESLint errors**: 14 errors and 43 warnings found, but none related to:
  - `@typescript-eslint/ban-types` (Function type)
  - `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`

## Conclusion

The TYPE-K-002 unit objectives have already been completed in previous work:
- All require() statements have been converted to ES6 imports
- No Function type usage exists in the codebase

The codebase is already compliant with modern ES6 module patterns and TypeScript best practices regarding function types.

## Recommendations

This unit can be marked as complete with no changes required. The remaining TypeScript and ESLint errors belong to other unit types (TYPE-B, TYPE-C, TYPE-D, etc.) and should be addressed by their respective units.

## Files Reviewed
- All files in `/packages/server/src/`
- Baseline error logs in the unit folder

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - No changes needed, objectives already met
