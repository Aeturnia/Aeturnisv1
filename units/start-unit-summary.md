# Type A Units Start Summary

**Initialization Time:** 2025-07-07  
**Total TypeScript Errors:** 411  
**Critical Type Definition Units:** 4  

## Unit Status

| Unit ID | Description | Status | Error Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| TYPE-A-001 | Combat Types | Initialized | ~50 errors |
| TYPE-A-002 | Monster Types | Ready | ~20 errors |

## TYPE-A-001 Baseline Captured

**Location:** `/units/TYPE-A-001/baseline-errors.txt`  
**Combat-related errors:** 50 errors captured  
**Key issues:**
- CombatSession missing: status, roundNumber
- Combatant missing: charId, charName  
- Property name mismatch: currentTurnIndex vs currentTurn
- Type incompatibility between combat.types and ICombatService

## Execution Notes

The start-unit.sh script has been successfully created and made executable. However, due to the current state of the codebase with multiple compilation errors, the full test suite cannot run cleanly. 

The baseline error capture is working correctly and we have:
1. Created the unit tracking structure
2. Captured baseline TypeScript errors for TYPE-A-001
3. Identified the specific type definition issues to fix

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Begin fixing TYPE-A-001 combat type definitions
2. Focus on adding missing properties to interfaces
3. Ensure type compatibility between related interfaces
4. Verify each fix reduces error count before proceeding

The Type Definition Agent can now proceed with fixing the combat types in TYPE-A-001.
