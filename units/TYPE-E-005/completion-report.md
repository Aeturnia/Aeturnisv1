# TYPE-E-005: Equipment Routes - Multi-Step Operations Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully improved equipment routes with proper return statements and async error handling, particularly in the equipment.routes.simple.ts file.

## Impact
- **TypeScript Errors**: 58 → 52 (6 errors fixed) ✅
- **ESLint Errors**: 69 → 69 (no change)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed equipment.routes.simple.ts
**Added AsyncHandler**:
- Added import: `import { asyncHandler } from '../middleware/asyncHandler';`
- Wrapped all 5 route handlers with asyncHandler

**Fixed Missing Return Statements**:
- Line 17: Added return to test endpoint success response
- Line 45: Added return to test endpoint error response
- Line 281: Added return to equip placeholder success response
- Line 295: Added return to equip placeholder error response  
- Line 312: Added return to unequip placeholder success response
- Line 325: Added return to unequip placeholder error response

### 2. Verified equipment.routes.ts
- Already had asyncHandler properly implemented
- All routes already had proper return statements
- No changes needed - this file was already following best practices

## Key Findings

### Already Correct (equipment.routes.ts)
1. **AsyncHandler usage** - All async routes properly wrapped
2. **Return statements** - All responses properly returned
3. **Error handling** - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
4. **Response format** - Consistent success/error structures
5. **Transaction handling** - Equipment swap operations properly handled

### Fixed Issues (equipment.routes.simple.ts)
1. Missing asyncHandler wrapper on all routes
2. Six missing return statements in route handlers
3. Now consistent with main equipment routes file

## Equipment Operation Handling
Both files now properly handle complex equipment operations:
- **Equip/Unequip** - Clear success/failure responses
- **Inventory moves** - Transaction status included
- **Item validation** - Can-equip checks with detailed responses
- **Value calculations** - Combined equipment/inventory values
- **Stats breakdown** - Comprehensive stat calculations with set bonuses

## Verification
- All equipment routes now have proper error handling
- No missing return statements in either file
- AsyncHandler catches all promise rejections
- Equipment swap operations provide clear feedback
- Response formats are consistent across both files

## Next Steps
- Continue with TYPE-E-006 for NPC & dialogue routes
- Apply similar patterns to remaining route files
- Consider consolidating simple routes into main routes once stable
