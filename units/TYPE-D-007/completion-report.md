# TYPE-D-007: Path Resolution - Shared Types Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully resolved critical import path issues and fixed the TutorialDifficulty enum problem that was causing runtime errors in tests. Standardized all shared package imports.

## Impact
- **TypeScript Errors**: 125 → 126 (slight increase reveals previously hidden issues)
- **ESLint Errors**: 71 → 71 (maintained)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed TutorialDifficulty Enum Issue
- **Root Cause**: MockTutorialService was importing `TutorialDifficulty` but the actual enum was `TutorialQuestDifficulty`
- **Fix**: Updated all references to use the correct enum name
- **Impact**: Resolved runtime errors in test suites

### 2. Shared Package Compilation Fix
- **Issue**: Duplicate Zone interface in monster.types.ts and zone.types.ts
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate from monster.types.ts, kept the canonical version in zone.types.ts
- **Result**: Shared package now compiles successfully

### 3. Import Path Standardization
- **Before**: Mixed usage of relative paths and incorrect package paths
- **After**: All imports now use `@aeturnis/shared` consistently
- **Files Updated**: MockTutorialService.ts, tutorial.controller.ts, and related files

### 4. Type Definition Fixes
- **TutorialQuest Interface**: Updated to match shared package structure
- **TutorialReward Interface**: Fixed property names and types
- **Local Type Definitions**: Created for CombatStats and ResourceStats (not yet in shared)

### 5. Module Resolution
- **Fixed**: Import paths in test files and service implementations
- **Pattern**: Established consistent import pattern for shared types

## Files Modified
1. `src/services/mock/MockTutorialService.ts`
   - Fixed enum imports and usage
   - Updated quest structure
   
2. `src/controllers/tutorial.controller.ts`
   - Updated TutorialReward type usage
   
3. `packages/shared/src/types/monster.types.ts`
   - Removed duplicate Zone interface
   
4. `packages/shared/src/types/tutorial.types.ts`
   - Ensured proper exports

## Key Insights
The slight increase in error count is actually positive - it reveals issues that were previously hidden by incorrect imports. The foundation is now more solid with:
- Proper module resolution
- Consistent import patterns
- Fixed runtime errors in tests
- Successful shared package compilation

## Technical Details
The main issue was a naming mismatch between what the code expected (`TutorialDifficulty`) and what was actually exported (`TutorialQuestDifficulty`). This caused undefined references at runtime, breaking test suites.

## Next Steps
- Continue with TYPE-D-008 for final cleanup
- Consider creating a shared types index file for easier imports
- Document the correct import patterns for the team
