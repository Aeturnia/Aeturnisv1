# üéÆ Equipment & Inventory Simple Implementation Audit Checklist

## üìã Overview
This audit checklist validates the **simple-first** implementation of the Equipment & Inventory system, focusing on API design, response formats, and frontend integration readiness before implementing complex backend infrastructure.

---

## ‚úÖ API Endpoint Structure Validation

### Route Registration
- [ ] `/api/v1/equipment` base path properly registered in Express app
- [ ] All routes use consistent REST conventions
- [ ] Route parameters follow naming conventions (`charId` not `characterId` or `char_id`)

### Endpoint Availability
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/equipment/test` returns 200 with test message
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/equipment/:charId` returns mock inventory data
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/equipment/:charId/equip` endpoint defined (even if stubbed)
- [ ] `POST /api/v1/equipment/:charId/unequip` endpoint defined (even if stubbed)
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/equipment/:charId/stats` endpoint planned or stubbed

### HTTP Status Codes
- [ ] 200 for successful GET requests
- [ ] 201 for successful item creation (future)
- [ ] 400 for invalid request format
- [ ] 404 for non-existent character (mock validation)
- [ ] 500 handled gracefully with error message

---

## üìê Response Format Consistency

### Standard Response Structure
```typescript
{
  success: boolean,
  data?: any,
  error?: string,
  timestamp: string
}
```

- [ ] All endpoints follow this structure
- [ ] `success: true` when data is returned
- [ ] `success: false` with error message on failures
- [ ] ISO timestamp included in all responses

### Equipment Data Format
- [ ] Each item includes all required fields:
  ```typescript
  {
    itemId: number,
    itemName: string,
    itemType: EquipmentType,
    slot: EquipmentSlot,
    stats: ItemStats,
    requirements: ItemRequirements,
    rarity: ItemRarity,
    equipped: boolean
  }
  ```
- [ ] Enums used consistently (not magic strings)
- [ ] Stats object properly nested with all combat attributes
- [ ] Requirements include level, class, and stat minimums

---

## üéØ TypeScript Type Correctness

### Type Definitions
- [ ] All interfaces exported from `/src/types/equipment.types.ts`
- [ ] No `any` types in route handlers
- [ ] Request/Response types properly typed
- [ ] Mock data satisfies TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Enum values match between types and mock data

### Type Safety Checks
- [ ] IDE shows no TypeScript errors in route files
- [ ] `npm run build` compiles without errors
- [ ] Autocomplete works for equipment properties
- [ ] Type guards implemented for runtime validation (if any)

---

## üéÆ Mock Data Realism

### Item Variety
- [ ] At least 3 different equipment types represented
- [ ] Multiple rarity tiers included (common ‚Üí legendary)
- [ ] Realistic MMORPG item names (Iron Sword, Steel Chestplate, etc.)
- [ ] Stats make sense for item types (swords have attack, armor has defense)

### Game Balance
- [ ] Item requirements scale with power level
- [ ] Higher rarity items have better stats
- [ ] No overpowered starter items
- [ ] Class restrictions make sense (warriors can't use staves)

### Inventory State
- [ ] Mix of equipped and unequipped items
- [ ] No duplicate items in same slot when equipped
- [ ] Reasonable inventory size (20-50 items for testing)
- [ ] Empty slots handled appropriately

---

## üîó Frontend Integration Readiness

### API Documentation
- [ ] README includes all endpoint definitions
- [ ] Request/Response examples provided
- [ ] cURL commands work for testing
- [ ] Postman collection created (optional but helpful)

### CORS & Headers
- [ ] CORS configured for local development
- [ ] Content-Type: application/json set correctly
- [ ] No authentication headers required (for now)
- [ ] Appropriate cache headers for mock data

### Error Handling
- [ ] Frontend-friendly error messages (not stack traces)
- [ ] Consistent error format across endpoints
- [ ] Validation errors clearly indicate the issue
- [ ] Network timeouts handled gracefully

---

## üìä Implementation Status Documentation

### Current State
- [ ] README clearly states "Simple Implementation - Mock Data"
- [ ] List of implemented endpoints documented
- [ ] List of planned but unimplemented features
- [ ] Known limitations explicitly stated

### Migration Path
- [ ] Comments indicate where database calls will go
- [ ] Service layer integration points marked
- [ ] Authentication middleware hookpoints identified
- [ ] Redis caching locations noted for future

### Code Organization
```typescript
// Example structure in routes file:
// TODO: Replace with equipmentService.getInventory(charId)
const mockInventory = generateMockInventory(charId);

// TODO: Add authentication middleware
// authMiddleware.requireUser,

// TODO: Add Redis caching
// cacheMiddleware.checkCache('inventory'),
```

## üß™ Manual Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/equipment/test` returns success
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/equipment/123` returns mock inventory
- [ ] Different charIds return slightly different inventories
- [ ] Invalid charId format returns 400 error

### Response Validation
- [ ] JSON is valid and properly formatted
- [ ] All enum values are recognized strings/numbers
- [ ] No null/undefined in required fields
- [ ] Arrays are never null (empty array instead)

### Performance
- [ ] Endpoints respond in < 100ms (mock data should be instant)
- [ ] No memory leaks during repeated calls
- [ ] Server doesn't crash on malformed requests

---

## üöÄ Production Readiness Assessment

### API Contract Stability
- [ ] Endpoint paths won't change when adding real data
- [ ] Response format matches final implementation plan
- [ ] Property names follow project conventions
- [ ] Version number (v1) appropriate

### Frontend Development Unblocked
- [ ] Frontend team can build against these endpoints
- [ ] Mock data sufficient for UI development
- [ ] All necessary item properties exposed
- [ ] Pagination strategy documented (even if not implemented)

### Next Steps Clear
- [ ] Database migration scripts ready to run
- [ ] Service layer interfaces match route needs
- [ ] Repository methods planned for each endpoint
- [ ] Test data seeds match mock data structure

## üîß Quick Audit Commands

```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Test endpoints manually
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/equipment/test
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/equipment/warrior-123 | jq .

# Verify route registration
grep -r "equipment" src/app.ts src/routes/

# Check for TODO/FIXME comments
grep -r "TODO" src/routes/equipment.routes.simple.ts
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

The simple implementation is considered **successful** when:

1. **Frontend can start development** without waiting for backend complexity
2. **API contracts are stable** and won't require breaking changes
3. **Mock data is realistic** enough to build proper UI components
4. **Documentation is clear** about current vs. future functionality
5. **Migration path is obvious** from simple to production implementation

This audit ensures we've built a solid API foundation before investing time in complex backend infrastructure.
