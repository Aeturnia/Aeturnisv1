 I just fixed a critical service initialization race condition in the React
  frontend. Please restart the development server and verify that the application
  loads correctly without errors.

  Steps to Follow:

  1. Stop any running servers (Ctrl+C if needed)
  2. Start the frontend development server:
  cd /home/runner/workspace
  npm run dev --workspace=packages/client

  3. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000
  4. Verify the following:
    - ‚úÖ The app should show "Initializing Aeturnis Online" loading screen briefly
    - ‚úÖ After loading, you should see the main game interface
    - ‚úÖ No "Something went wrong" error page should appear
    - ‚úÖ Check browser console - there should be NO "Services not initialized yet"
  errors
    - ‚úÖ You should see the Mock Mode indicator (yellow badge with üé≠) in the
  top-left
    - ‚úÖ The gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) should be visible in the bottom-right for developer
  tools
    - ‚úÖ The "Test Services" button should be visible in the bottom-left
  5. Test the services:
    - Click the "Test Services" button
    - Click "Test All Services" in the panel
    - Check console for "All services tested successfully!" message
    - Verify character, inventory, and location data displays in the test panel
  6. Navigate between screens:
    - Click on Character tab - should show Aria Starweaver's stats
    - Click on Equipment tab - should show equipment slots
    - Click on Game tab - should show the game world with HUD elements

  What Was Fixed:

  - Added null checks to all service hooks to prevent calling methods on
  uninitialized services
  - Fixed state mapping in inventory and location hooks
  - Protected component useEffect hooks from calling null service methods
  - Enhanced error boundary for better error display
  - Improved useServices hook to return mock implementation during initialization

  Expected Console Output:

  Initializing Aeturnis Online app...
  Service config: {apiBaseUrl: "http://localhost:5000", wsUrl:
  "ws://localhost:5000", ...}
  Mock mode enabled - Using mock services
  Initializing services...
  Services initialized successfully!
  App initialized successfully!

  If you see any errors or the app doesn't load properly, please share:
  1. The exact error message from the browser console
  2. What you see on screen
  3. Any network errors in the browser's Network tab

  The race condition should be completely resolved now!
