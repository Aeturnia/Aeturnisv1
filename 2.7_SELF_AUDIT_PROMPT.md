# 2.7 Implementation Self-Audit Prompt

## Context
You need to perform a comprehensive self-audit of the Step 2.7: World & Movement system implementation for Aeturnis Online. The implementation should include Zone System, Movement Validation, and Progression Tracking with BigInt support.

## Audit Checklist

### 1. File Structure Verification
Verify the following files exist and are properly implemented:

**Services:**
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/services/zone.service.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/services/movement.service.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/services/progression.service.ts`

**Mock Services:**
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/providers/mock/MockZoneService.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/providers/mock/MockMovementService.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/providers/mock/MockProgressionService.ts`

**Controllers:**
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/controllers/zone.controller.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/controllers/movement.controller.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/controllers/progression.controller.ts`

**Routes:**
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/routes/zone.routes.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/routes/movement.routes.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/routes/progression.routes.ts`

**Types:**
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/types/zone.types.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/types/movement.types.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/types/progression.types.ts`

**Tests:**
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/__tests__/zone.service.test.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/__tests__/movement.service.test.ts`
- [ ] `/packages/server/src/__tests__/progression.service.test.ts`

### 2. Zone System Requirements
Verify the Zone Service implementation:

```typescript
// Check for these methods in ZoneService
- getZoneById(zoneId: string): Promise<Zone>
- getAllZones(): Promise<Zone[]>
- getZonesByType(type: ZoneType): Promise<Zone[]>
- validateZoneBoundaries(coordinates: Coordinates): Promise<boolean>
```

**Zone Data Structure:**
- [ ] Contains at least 6 interconnected zones
- [ ] Each zone has unique ID, displayName, description
- [ ] Coordinates system implemented (x, y)
- [ ] Boundaries defined (minX, maxX, minY, maxY)
- [ ] Exits properly mapped (north, south, east, west)
- [ ] Zone types defined (normal, city, dungeon, pvp)
- [ ] Features array implemented (shops, trainers, bank, etc.)
- [ ] Level requirements present
- [ ] All zones form a navigable world map

### 3. Movement System Requirements
Verify the Movement Service implementation:

```typescript
// Check for these methods in MovementService
- validateMovement(characterId: string, fromZone: string, toZone: string, direction: Direction): Promise<ValidationResult>
- moveCharacter(characterId: string, direction: Direction): Promise<MoveResponse>
- checkMovementCooldown(characterId: string): Promise<number>
- updateCharacterPosition(characterId: string, zoneId: string): Promise<void>
```

**Movement Validation:**
- [ ] Validates exit exists in requested direction
- [ ] Checks character level requirements
- [ ] Enforces movement cooldown (2 seconds)
- [ ] Validates character not in combat
- [ ] Handles locked/quest-gated zones
- [ ] Updates character coordinates on successful move

### 4. Progression System Requirements
Verify the Progression Service implementation:

```typescript
// Check for these methods in ProgressionService
- awardExperience(characterId: string, amount: bigint): Promise<ExperienceResult>
- allocateStatPoints(characterId: string, stat: StatType, points: number): Promise<AllocationResult>
- calculatePowerScore(characterId: string): Promise<PowerScoreResult>
- getCharacterProgression(characterId: string): Promise<CharacterProgression>
```

**BigInt Implementation:**
- [ ] Experience stored as BigInt
- [ ] NextLevelExp calculated with BigInt
- [ ] Proper BigInt serialization (toString() for JSON)
- [ ] Experience curve formula implemented
- [ ] Level-up mechanics trigger stat point awards

**Power Score:**
- [ ] Formula includes level contribution
- [ ] Formula includes stat contribution
- [ ] Formula includes mock equipment contribution
- [ ] Returns breakdown of score components

### 5. API Endpoints Verification

**Zone Endpoints:**
- [ ] GET `/api/v1/zones` - Returns all zones
- [ ] GET `/api/v1/zones/:id` - Returns specific zone
- [ ] GET `/api/v1/zones/type/:type` - Returns zones by type

**Movement Endpoints:**
- [ ] POST `/api/v1/movement/move` - Handles character movement
- [ ] GET `/api/v1/movement/cooldown/:characterId` - Returns cooldown status

**Progression Endpoints:**
- [ ] POST `/api/v1/progression/award-xp` - Awards experience
- [ ] POST `/api/v1/progression/allocate-stat` - Allocates stat points
- [ ] GET `/api/v1/progression/power-score/:characterId` - Returns power score
- [ ] GET `/api/v1/progression/:characterId` - Returns character progression

### 6. Service Provider Integration
Verify services are registered:

```typescript
// In initializeProviders.ts
- [ ] ZoneService registered with ServiceProvider
- [ ] MovementService registered with ServiceProvider
- [ ] ProgressionService registered with ServiceProvider
```

Check the registration in `/packages/server/src/providers/initializeProviders.ts`:
- Services should be registered around lines 126-152
- All three services should log "✅ [ServiceName] registered"

### 7. Route Integration
Verify routes are mounted in `app.ts`:

```typescript
// Around lines 124-126 in app.ts
app.use('/api/v1/zones', generalLimiter, zoneRoutes);
app.use('/api/v1/movement', generalLimiter, movementRoutes);
app.use('/api/v1/progression', generalLimiter, progressionRoutes);
```

### 8. Error Handling
Verify all error cases are handled:

**Zone Errors:**
- [ ] Invalid zone ID returns 404
- [ ] Zone boundary violations handled

**Movement Errors:**
- [ ] Invalid direction returns 400
- [ ] Movement on cooldown returns 429
- [ ] Insufficient level returns 403
- [ ] No exit in direction returns 400
- [ ] Character not found returns 404

**Progression Errors:**
- [ ] Negative experience returns 400
- [ ] Invalid stat type returns 400
- [ ] Insufficient stat points returns 400
- [ ] Character not found returns 404
- [ ] BigInt parsing errors handled

### 9. Testing Coverage

Run the following commands and verify results:

```bash
# Run specific test suites
npm test -- zone.service.test.ts
npm test -- movement.service.test.ts
npm test -- progression.service.test.ts

# Check overall coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Required Coverage:**
- [ ] Statements: ≥80%
- [ ] Branches: ≥80%
- [ ] Functions: ≥80%
- [ ] Lines: ≥80%

### 10. TypeScript & Linting

Run these commands and verify zero errors:

```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### 11. Mock Data Validation

**Zone Mock Data:**
- [ ] At least 6 zones defined
- [ ] All zone exits lead to valid zones
- [ ] No orphaned zones (unreachable)
- [ ] Starter zone accessible at level 1
- [ ] Progressive level requirements

**Character Mock Data:**
- [ ] Sample characters with BigInt experience
- [ ] Various progression states (level 1, 5, 10, etc.)
- [ ] Stat allocations present
- [ ] Movement history/cooldowns tracked

### 12. Manual Testing

Start the server and test these scenarios:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Test Zone Retrieval:**
```bash
# Get all zones
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/zones

# Get specific zone
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/zones/starter_city
```

**Test Movement:**
```bash
# Move character north
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/movement/move \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"characterId": "char_001", "currentZoneId": "starter_city", "direction": "north"}'
```

**Test Progression:**
```bash
# Award XP
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/progression/award-xp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"characterId": "char_001", "amount": "1000", "source": "quest"}'

# Get power score
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/progression/power-score/char_001
```

## Additional Verification

1. **BigInt Serialization**: Ensure all BigInt values are converted to strings in JSON responses
2. **Mock Data Consistency**: Verify zone exits are bidirectional (if A exits north to B, B should exit south to A)
3. **Service Layer Pattern**: Controllers should only call service methods, no direct data manipulation
4. **Type Safety**: No `any` types or `@ts-ignore` comments
5. **Documentation**: All public methods have JSDoc comments

## Success Criteria

The implementation is considered complete when:
- All files are present and properly structured
- All tests pass with ≥80% coverage
- Zero TypeScript errors and ESLint warnings
- All API endpoints return expected responses
- Movement between zones works correctly
- Experience and leveling system functions with BigInt
- Power score calculations are accurate
- All error cases are handled gracefully
