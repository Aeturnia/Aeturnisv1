## Overall Score: 7.5/10

The implementation demonstrates strong foundational architecture with comprehensive tooling setup, but lacks substantial application code and production-ready features.

## Key Findings

✅ **Strengths:**
- Proper TypeScript monorepo structure with packages/server
- Comprehensive testing framework (100% pass rate on existing tests)
- Modern development tooling integration (ESLint v9, Vitest, TypeScript)
- Clean separation of concerns with proper configuration inheritance
- Functional build and development workflows

⚠️ **Areas for Improvement:**
- Minimal actual application code (only basic greet function)
- No Express server implementation despite Express dependency
- Missing environment configuration and logging
- Limited error handling and production considerations
- No CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Basic security considerations needed

## Next Steps

Refer to the detailed recommendations in each category for specific improvement actions.
